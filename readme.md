<h3> Imortals About Me &#x2798; </h3>

<p>
  This is where i leave projects i either forget or dont work on. rarely do i have a ongoing project.
   one of those rare cases is Jzxy an <b> Online Crasher </b> designed by me and coded by me and controbutors.
   it's been an amazing year making these projects with people that actually have a good use to them.
